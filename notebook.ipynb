There are 2000 unique claim IDs in the data and no null values. No changes were needed to this column.\n\n* In the second column, *time_to_close* there are no missing values and each value is a positive integer so no changes were necessary here.\n\n* The *claim_amount* column had no missing values. I trimmed off the first three characters 'R$ ' and formated the column as numeric with two decimal places so that it is ready for analysis.\n\n* In the *amount_paid_column*, there were 36 missing values which were labelled as 'NA'. I calculated the median value as R$ 20,105.70 which I inserted into each row where the value was missing.\n\n* The *location* column has one of the four location names, as listed in the description, per row and there were no missing values. No changes needed to this column.\n\n* The *individuals_on_claim* column contained no missing values and all values were between 1 and 15. No changes were made to this column.\n\n* The *linked_cases* column should either contain 'TRUE' or 'FALSE' but there were 26 rows that contained the value 'NA'. These rows had the value changed to 'FALSE'.\n\n* The *cause* column should have one of three values: 'meat', 'vegetable', or 'unknown'. However, there were 16 rows that contained 'VEGETABLES' and 14 rows that contained 'Meat'. For correct formatting, these rows were changed to all lower case characters. The extra 'S' from 'VEGETABLES' was also removed. There were no missing values.\n\nThe total number of rows and columns did not change after data cleaning.\n","metadata":{"tags":[]},"id":"714a7083-7a43-4b0b-8ed4-2675efc87691","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Task 2","metadata":{},"id":"643d4c36-4183-4fbe-a263-6b9de60d29da","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Number of Claims per Location\n\nThe below graph shows the number of claims that each location has in the dataset. Out of the four locations, *Recife* has the most claims with *Sao Luis* having the second most claims but with just over half that of *Recife*. *Fortaleza* and *Natal* have about a third of the number of claims that *Recife* has. *Recife* by far has the most number of claims so there is an un-balance in the number of claims per location.\n\n![Screen Shot 2023-02-15 at 2.38.55 PM](Screen%20Shot%202023-02-15%20at%202.38.55%20PM.png)\n\n","metadata":{},"id":"1d5ba38c-1b3a-4f9b-bf38-bb0a62dac346","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Task 3","metadata":{},"id":"ce5f6df2-fbf2-4c44-9209-9ee668876b53","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## How Long Claims Take to Close\n\nThe primary goal of the legal department is to improve the time taken to close claims. In the graph below, we can see the distribution of time taken to close claims *across all locations* of the legal department. From the graph, we can see that the most frequent (mode) time to close a claim is between 170 and 180 days (The exact value of the mode is 179 days. The average (mean) time to close was calculated at 186 days). We can also see a trend of outlying claims that are beyond the 75th percentile that can take significantly longer to close. Lets take a different view of these outliers. \n\n\n![Screen Shot 2023-02-15 at 3.44.47 PM](Screen%20Shot%202023-02-15%20at%203.44.47%20PM.png)\n\n\nThe box plot below shows the distribution of closing time across all locations. The inter quartile range is 158 to 204 days. We can see that the range of claims that have a response time beyond the 75th percentile is large. This means that there are outlying claims where customers have had to wait much longer than others for their case to be resolved.\n\n![Screen Shot 2023-02-15 at 4.45.16 PM](Screen%20Shot%202023-02-15%20at%204.45.16%20PM.png)\n","metadata":{},"id":"8fcff247-db49-42c0-8710-51848aeb6347","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Task 4","metadata":{},"id":"c5fbe3a0-d277-437c-a1a0-f1edf80684f7","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Time to close by Location.\n\nWhen we look at time to close by location, we can see that all locations have a large range of outlying claims which take much longer to close than the average. Aside from outliers, each location has a similar interquartile range and similar values for both the upper and lower whiskers. This implies that the majority of claims get processed and closed in a similar amount of time across all four locations.\n\n![Screen Shot 2023-02-15 at 4.56.20 PM](Screen%20Shot%202023-02-15%20at%204.56.20%20PM.png)\n\nBased upon the above analysis, my first recommendation is that any intervention to improve time taken to close claims would be most impactful at *Recife* as this location has far more claims than any other. Recife has more claims that Forteleza and Natal combined; increasing performance at this location would affect the most number of customers. Recife has a similar performance to the other locations but if it performed *better* than the others, a larger percentage of customers would have a shorter wait time for claims to close. Any additional expenditures to increase performance (hiring more staff, or better technology for example) would have the largest return on investment at the Recife location.\n\nMy second recomendation would be to conduct a further investigation into the outlying claims that take longer than 273 days to close. Although these represent a minority of cases, they represent customers who have had to wait double (nearly tripple in the most extreme cases) the amount of time that other customers have had to wait. A benefit of reducing the number of outliers is that it would have a strong impact on the mean value of time to close across all claims. For example, if the outliers in the current dataset were to be removed (all claims longer than 273 days), the new mean would be 145 days which is a 22% decrease from 186 days. Mean values are common metrics used to assess performance and by limiting any future incidences of outliers it would ensure that this key metric does not get inflated negatively. I recommend conducting a review of all current claims that are approaching the 204 day mark (the 75th percentile) and ensuring that, if possible, these are closed in a timely manner.","metadata":{},"id":"170dd2ea-340f-4ab4-94c8-fe077342e98e","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## âœ… When you have finished...\n-  Publish your Workspace using the option on the left\n-  Check the published version of your report:\n\t-  Can you see everything you want us to grade?\n    -  Are all the graphics visible?\n-  Review the grading rubric.
